# Weather-App

The following web application is used to get the weather information of all major NZ airports using the weather api. 

In order to run the code please, create an account on weather api and insert your API key in the getAirportWeather.js file line 4.

I ask you to create your own program in Python, JavaScript or .NET that 
uses https://www.weatherapi.com/ to get the weather of all major airports

in New Zealand (you decide which ones are major). Please do not use a SDK 
and make sure you comment your code to show the process you went through.

Program should at least print out:
路 Airport Name and Region
路 Temperature in Celsius
路 The Weather Condition
路 Wind in kph
